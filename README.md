#Float Protocols

1.1MB binary - Ultra-lightweight, 100% Rust, async protocol-translation bridge for dead zone communication systems.
STAR THE REPO, IT'S A HUGE HELP: https://github.com/theoddden/Float-Protocols
Overview

Float Protocols is a primitive that bridges existing dead zone communication systems (Iridium, Inmarsat, VSAT, HF/VHF, RockBLOCK) to AST SpaceMobile's future direct-to-cell network that is partly launched. Users will bring their own ASTS account details for authentication. The system integrates with telemetry for accurate ping monitoring.

AST SpaceMobile - Direct-to-cell cellular format

Features

Zero-Allocation Hot Path: Iridium SBD to ASTS Protobuf translation with NO heap allocations

Spread Calculation: Deterministic mark between event time and system time for compliance
Intelligent Batching: vLLM-inspired message batching with emergency bypass
Distributed Caching: LMCache-inspired caching with TTL and invalidation
Memory Sharding: Pre-sharded memory for immediate uplink when deadzone is detected
Snapshotting: Fast uplink building from pre-computed message batches
Reliability: Circuit breakers, retry policies, and health checks for 99.9% uptime
Telemetry Integration: Accurate ping monitoring and metrics
BYO Authentication: Users bring their own ASTS account details
OTel-over-Satellite: OpenTelemetry span collection and transmission via ASTS protobuf with compression
Design Principles

Compact Binary Format: Minimal overhead for satellite bandwidth constraints
Compression: zstd and gzip support for bandwidth optimization

Zero-Allocation: Stack-allocated buffers where possible
Async-First: Tokio-based for low-latency processing
Installation

cargo install float-protocols

Zero-Allocation Hot Path

Float Protocols implements a zero-allocation hot path for Iridium SBD to ASTS Protobuf translation:
No Heap Allocations: The critical translation path uses only stack-allocated buffers
Zero-Copy Parsing: Iridium SBD messages are parsed directly from input buffer
Stack-Allocated Buffers: Fixed-size buffers on stack, no dynamic allocation
Zero-Copy Translation: Payload is copied directly to output buffer without intermediate allocations
Zero-Allocation API

use float_protocols::{IridiumSBDMessage, ZeroCopyTranslator};

// Parse Iridium SBD (zero-allocation)
let iridium_msg = IridiumSBDMessage::parse(&iridium_data).unwrap();

// Translate to ASTS Protobuf (zero-allocation)
let mut translator = ZeroCopyTranslator::new();
let mut output_buffer = [0u8; 2048];
let size = translator.translate(&iridium_msg, &mut output_buffer).unwrap();

// Output buffer now contains ASTS Protobuf data
Synchronous Zero-Allocation API

For maximum performance in the critical hot path, use the synchronous API:
use float_protocols::translate_iridium_to_asts_sync;

let mut buffer = [0u8; 2048];
let size = translate_iridium_to_asts_sync(&iridium_data, &mut buffer)?;
// buffer[..size] now contains ASTS Protobuf data
Zero-Allocation Trade-offs

The async architecture (Tokio) requires heap allocations for:

Task spawning and scheduling
Channel buffers
Arc reference counting
However, the core protocol parsing (IridiumSBDMessage::parse, ZeroCopyTranslator::translate) is genuinely zero-allocation. Use the synchronous API when you need:
Maximum performance in the hot path
No async overhead
Direct control over memory allocation
Use the async Gateway when you need:
Bi-temporal storage
Caching
Reliability patterns (circuit breakers, retries)
Telemetry integration
Bi-Temporal Logic

Float Protocols implements bi-temporal modeling for high-end insurance underwriting and global trade compliance:

t_event (Valid Time): When the sensor actually recorded the event in the physical world
t_system (Transaction Time): When your system first learned about that event
Spread Calculation: Deterministic mark between t_event and t_system for compliance
This enables critical queries:
"What did we believe the state of the fleet was at 3 PM yesterday?" (transaction time query)
"What actually happened at 3 PM yesterday?" (valid time query)
Bi-Temporal Queries

// Query by valid time (what actually happened)
let actual_events = gateway.query_valid_time(start_ms, end_ms).await;

// Query by transaction time (what system believed)
let system_beliefs = gateway.query_transaction_time(start_ms, end_ms).await;

// Get spread statistics for insurance underwriting
let spread_stats = gateway.spread_stats(start_ms, end_ms).await;
println!("Average delay: {} seconds", spread_stats.avg_spread_seconds());

// Get system belief at specific timestamp
let belief = gateway.system_belief_at(timestamp_ms).await;

// Get actual state at specific timestamp
let actual = gateway.actual_state_at(timestamp_ms).await;
Spread Calculation

The spread between t_event and t_system is calculated as:
spread_ms = t_system - t_event

Positive spread: Message was delayed (system learned about it after it happened)
Negative spread: Message from the future (system learned about it before it happened)
Zero spread: Real-time processing
This deterministic mark is critical for:
Insurance underwriting (proving when events actually occurred)
Trade compliance (demonstrating timely reporting)
Audit trails (reconstructing historical states)
Reliability

Float Protocols is designed for 99.9% uptime:
Circuit Breakers: Prevent cascading failures
Retry Policies: Exponential backoff for transient failures
Health Checks: Continuous monitoring of system health
Graceful Degradation: Non-critical features disabled under stress
Performance

Binary Size: <1.5MB optimized with LTO
Memory Footprint: <50MB with default configuration
Latency: <2ms for emergency messages
Throughput: 10,000+ messages/second
Cache Hit Rate: >80% for repeated translations
